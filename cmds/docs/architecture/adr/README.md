# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Purpose
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document significant architectural decisions made during the development of a project. Each ADR captures the context, decision, consequences, and rationale for important technical choices that shape the system's architecture.

## Structure
- Each ADR is a standalone markdown file in this directory.
- ADRs are numbered sequentially with 4 digits (adr-0001, adr-0002, etc.).
- Each ADR follows a consistent template format.
- ADRs are immutable once accepted - new decisions create new ADRs.

## Usage
- Use the ADR template to document new architectural decisions.
- Reference ADRs in code comments, documentation, and discussions.
- Review ADRs when considering architectural changes.
- Update ADRs only to add new decisions, never to modify existing ones.

## ADR Status
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision made and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Superseded by newer decision
- **Superseded**: Replaced by another ADR

## Current ADRs
<!-- Add ADRs as they are created, following the pattern:
- [ADR-0001: Title](adr-0001-title.md)
-->

*No ADRs have been created yet. Use the template to document your first architectural decision.*
