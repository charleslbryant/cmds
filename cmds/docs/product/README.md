# Product Documentation

This directory contains the core product context that guides all development decisions.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Template Files Must Be Customized

**The files in this directory are templates that MUST be replaced with your project's actual product information.**

**DO NOT proceed with development until these files contain your real product context.**

## Files Overview

### product-vision.md
**STATUS**: ⚠️ TEMPLATE - MUST BE CUSTOMIZED
- Contains your product's vision statement, problem definition, and target audience
- Used by AI assistants to understand the product's purpose and direction
- Critical for making development decisions aligned with product goals

### product-strategy.md  
**STATUS**: ⚠️ TEMPLATE - MUST BE CUSTOMIZED
- Contains your product's strategic approach, development phases, and technology choices
- Used by AI assistants to understand technical constraints and strategic priorities
- Critical for making architecture and implementation decisions

## Customization Checklist

Before using CMDS, ensure you have:

- [ ] Replaced product-vision.md with your actual product vision
- [ ] Replaced product-strategy.md with your actual product strategy
- [ ] Removed all template warnings and placeholder content
- [ ] Validated that the content accurately represents your product

## Why This Matters

AI assistants use these files to:
- Understand what features to prioritize
- Make technical decisions that align with your strategy
- Ensure all development work supports your product goals
- Maintain consistency across development sessions

**Using template content will result in incorrect development decisions and wasted effort.**
