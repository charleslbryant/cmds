# Design Phase Integration Summary

## What We've Implemented

The design phase has been fully integrated into CMDS to ensure thoughtful technical planning before implementation. This is especially critical for using CMDS to develop CMDS itself.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Command: `/design`
- Created `/home/cbryant/projects/cmds/.claude/commands/design.md`
- Positioned between `/plan` and `/dev` in the workflow
- Includes comprehensive checklist for design activities
- Requires design approval before moving to development

### 2. Updated Command Transitions
- `/plan` now transitions to `/design` (not directly to `/dev`)
- `/design` transitions to `/dev` or back to `/plan`
- `/dev` can return to `/design` if architecture changes needed
- `/begin` can go directly to `/design` for well-defined tasks

### 3. Documentation Structure
```
/docs/design/
├── README.md                    # Explains ADR vs Design relationship
├── DESIGN_PHASE_INTEGRATION.md  # This file
├── api-design-template.md       # For API specifications
└── features/                    # Feature design documents
    ├── README.md               # Feature design guide
    ├── feature-design-template.md
    └── feat-0001-cmds-design-phase.md  # Example design
```

### 4. New Rule Documents
- `/docs/rules/design-phase.md` - Design process and workflow
- `/docs/rules/cmds-promotion-criteria.md` - Criteria for promoting changes from root to /cmds

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Main README.md updated to include design phase
- Session workflow updated to show full cycle: Plan → Design → Develop → QA → Evaluate
- Command files updated with new transitions

## New Workflow

### Before (Direct to Development)
```
/begin → /plan → /dev → /deliver → /qa
```

### After (Design First)
```
/begin → /plan → /design → /dev → /deliver → /qa
                    ↑         ↓
                    ←---------←
```

## Using the Design Phase

### When to Create a Design
- Non-trivial features requiring architecture decisions
- Changes affecting multiple components
- New API endpoints or data models
- Features with multiple implementation approaches
- Any change to CMDS itself

### When to Skip Design
- Simple bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Trivial refactoring
- Emergency hotfixes (document decisions afterward)

### Design Document Contents
1. Problem statement and requirements
2. Technical approach with alternatives
3. Architecture decisions
4. Implementation details
5. Testing strategy
6. Risk assessment
7. Migration/rollout plan

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Relationship to ADRs
- **ADRs** (`/docs/architecture/adr/`): System-wide architectural decisions
- **Feature Designs** (`/docs/design/features/`): Feature-specific implementation details
- Create ADRs when design reveals significant architectural decisions
- Link between feature designs and related ADRs

### GitHub Integration
- Reference design documents in pull requests
- Link designs to issues
- Update design status when implementing

## Best Practices

### Do
- Start with the simplest solution that works
- Document alternatives considered
- Update designs based on implementation learnings
- Get design review before starting development
- Link to relevant code after implementation

### Don't
- Over-engineer solutions
- Create designs for trivial changes
- Let designs become stale
- Skip design review
- Design in isolation

## Promotion Workflow for CMDS

Since we're using CMDS to develop CMDS:

1. **Design in root CMDS** - Create design documents
2. **Implement in root CMDS** - Develop and test features
3. **Review promotion criteria** - Check `/docs/rules/cmds-promotion-criteria.md`
4. **Selective promotion** - Copy only tested, approved changes to `/cmds`
5. **Integration test** - Verify in user CMDS environment
6. **Document changes** - Update user documentation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Use design phase for next CMDS feature
2. Gather feedback on design process
3. Refine templates based on usage

### Future Enhancements
- Automated design document creation
- Design review automation
- Integration with project management tools
- Design metrics and analytics

## Questions and Feedback

The design phase is now integrated but will evolve based on usage. Key questions to consider:

1. Is the design template comprehensive enough?
2. Should certain types of changes require mandatory design?
3. How formal should design reviews be?
4. What's the right balance between documentation and development speed?

## Conclusion

The design phase adds a crucial thinking step between planning and coding. While it adds some overhead, it ensures:
- Better technical decisions
- Fewer implementation surprises
- Clear documentation of approaches
- Easier maintenance and evolution

This is especially important for CMDS developing itself, where changes can affect the entire development workflow.
