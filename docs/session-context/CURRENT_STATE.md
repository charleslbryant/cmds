## Current Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Documentation-based methodology with YAML command configuration
- **Documentation**: Markdown files with structured context management
- **Architecture**: Mode-based workflow system with persistent context tracking

### Commands/Features Implemented
- **7 Mode System** - Complete workflow commands (kick, begin, plan, design, dev, deliver, qa) ✅
- **Rule Framework** - 7 comprehensive rule files covering all development aspects ✅  
- **Context Management** - Persistent session state and project context tracking ✅
- **GitHub Integration** - Issue templates, workflows, and hooks configured ✅
- **Documentation Foundation** - Product vision, strategy, and architecture complete ✅

### Core Components
- **Mode System** - `.claude/commands/` with 7 modes + configuration
- **Governance** - `/docs/rules/` with comprehensive development rules
- **Context Management** - `/docs/session-context/` for persistent state
- **Project Context** - `/docs/product/`, `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/design/`

### Infrastructure (GitHub Integration)
- **Repository** - Private GitHub repository with complete foundation
- **Issue Management** - PRD, CRD, Task templates configured
- **Workflows** - GitHub Actions for validation and metrics
- **Branch Protection** - Ready for main branch protection rules

### Documentation Architecture
- **Product Documentation** - Vision and strategy documents
- **Technical Documentation** - Architecture and ADR framework
- **Process Documentation** - Rules and workflow guides
- **Session Documentation** - Context management and handoff templates

## Build Status
- ✅ Repository: Clean deployment (79 files, 7059+ lines)
- ✅ Documentation: Complete and current
- ✅ GitHub Integration: Functional (issues, templates, workflows)
- ✅ Code Quality: CMDS methodology standards followed

## Technical Decisions (ADRs)
- Architecture Decision Records framework established ✅
- Mode-based workflow system design complete ✅
- Documentation-first approach for tool-agnostic methodology ✅
- GitHub label system design: 18 labels across 4 categories with consistent color scheme ✅

## Active Work  
- **COMPLETED**: PRD #1 - CMDS Project Foundation Setup ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #2 - GitHub Repository and Development Foundation ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #3 - Initialize session context files with real project information ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #6 - Setup CMDS GitHub labels (task breakdown created) ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #7 - Create and configure CMDS GitHub label system ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #8 - Apply CMDS labels to existing issues #1-6 ✅
- **IN PROGRESS**: CRD #6 - Additional integration tasks created (Issues #11-13)
- **STATUS**: Issues #7-8 ready for delivery, CRD #6 needs kick mode integration and branch protection

## Next Major Features to Implement
1. **Kick Mode Enhancement** - Automated project setup and template customization
2. **Begin Mode Improvements** - Enhanced context loading and task selection
3. **Tooling Integration** - IDE extensions and CLI tools for CMDS workflow
4. **Community Features** - Templates gallery and adoption guides
5. **Validation Tools** - Automated CMDS compliance checking

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ GitHub Repository Access
- ✅ Complete CMDS Methodology Foundation
- ✅ Authentication and Permissions

## Context for Next Session

### Required Reading (Session Startup)
1. **Product Context**: Read `/docs/product/` for foundational product vision and strategy
2. **Architecture**: Read `/docs/architecture.md` for project overview and approach
3. **Current Progress**: Read this file (`CURRENT_STATE.md`) for development state
4. **Task Queue**: Read `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md` for prioritized work

### Development Context
- **Project Status**: CMDS methodology foundation complete and deployed to GitHub
- **Development Approach**: Self-application of CMDS methodology to develop CMDS itself
- **Architecture Foundation**: Complete mode-based workflow system with documentation-driven context management
- **Ready For**: Full CMDS development cycles, methodology validation, and enhancement work
