## Task Details

### Issue #6: Setup CMDS GitHub labels and apply to existing issues (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Implement complete CMDS label system from task-management.md and apply to existing issues
- **Approach**: Create all Priority/Status/Scope/Type labels with proper colors, then label issues #1-6
- **Command**: `gh label create` for all 18 labels from task-management.md
- **Tests**: Verify all labels created correctly and existing issues properly categorized
- **Estimated time**: 1 hour

### Issue #4: Kick mode git/GitHub repository setup (Priority: Now - Critical)
- **Goal**: Fix fundamental project setup problems for new CMDS projects
- **Approach**: Enhance kick mode to handle git init, GitHub repo creation, authentication
- **Tests**: Test kick mode with new project setup scenarios
- **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours

### Issue #5: Team-safe session context approach (Priority: Now - Critical)
- **Goal**: Resolve session context conflicts for team development
- **Approach**: Implement developer-scoped context folders with shared project state
- **Tests**: Test approach with multiple developer scenarios
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Issue #8: Validate first complete CMDS workflow cycle (Priority: Next)
- **Goal**: Execute a complete begin → plan → design → dev → deliver → qa cycle to validate methodology
- **Approach**: Use existing issues as test case, follow all CMDS rules strictly
- **Tests**: Document workflow execution, identify any process gaps or improvements
- **Estimated time**: 4-6 hours

## Session Planning Notes

### For Next Session
- Read CURRENT_STATE.md for architecture context
- Pick ONE task from "Now" priority (Issues #4 or #5)
- Follow CMDS workflow rules and documentation standards
- Update context files when task is completed
- Maintain GitHub issue tracking and proper labeling

### Context Requirements
- **Minimal**: Current task + GitHub repository access
- **Reference**: Git workflow rules, task management rules
- **Process**: Follow task management rules for GitHub issue workflows
- **Documentation**: Update session context files upon completion
