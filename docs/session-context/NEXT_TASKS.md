- **Tests**: Verify labels can be applied to issues correctly
- **Estimated time**: 30 minutes

### Issue #6: Validate first complete CMDS workflow cycle (Priority: Next)
- **Goal**: Execute a complete begin → plan → design → dev → deliver → qa cycle to validate methodology
- **Approach**: Use existing issues as test case, follow all CMDS rules strictly
- **Tests**: Document workflow execution, identify any process gaps or improvements
- **Estimated time**: 4-6 hours

## Session Planning Notes

### For Next Session
- Read CURRENT_STATE.md for architecture context
- Pick ONE task from "Now" priority (Issues #4 or #5)
- Follow CMDS workflow rules and documentation standards
- Update context files when task is completed
