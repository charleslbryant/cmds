## Session Information
- **Started**: 2025-07-15
- **Focus**: Plan mode execution for CRD #6 - GitHub labels setup
- **Task**: Complete task breakdown and planning for CMDS label system
- **Current Status**: Ready for /dev mode transition with Issue #7 selected

## Session Progress

### âœ… Completed This Session (Planning Mode Execution)
1. **Mode Context Loading** - Read all rule files and session context files
2. **PRD Validation** - Confirmed PRD #1 exists and CRDs properly created
3. **CRD Analysis** - Reviewed Issue #6 with comprehensive acceptance criteria
4. **Task Breakdown** - Created 4 specific tasks (Issues #7-10) for CRD #6:
   - Issue #7: Create and configure CMDS GitHub label system (SELECTED)
   - Issue #8: Apply CMDS labels to existing issues #1-6
   - Issue #9: Integrate GitHub label setup into kick mode  
   - Issue #10: Document CMDS label system usage
5. **Priority Assignment** - Issue #7 selected as foundational "Now" priority
6. **Scope Validation** - All tasks align with CRD #6 goals and include kick mode integration
7. **Session Context Updates** - Updated CURRENT_STATE.md and NEXT_TASKS.md with planning results

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made
- `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Updated active work status and progress
- `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md` - Added Issues #7-10 to task queue with proper prioritization  
- `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md` - Documented planning session progress
- **GitHub Issues** - Created Issues #7-10 with clear acceptance criteria

### ðŸ“‹ Key Planning Decisions
1. **Task Sequencing**: Issue #7 (label creation) must precede all other label-related work
2. **Kick Mode Integration**: Issue #9 addresses operator requirement for label setup in kick mode
3. **Foundational Priority**: GitHub labels are prerequisite for proper CMDS issue tracking
4. **Systematic Approach**: Four focused tasks cover creation, application, integration, and documentation

### ðŸš€ Planning Deliverables
- **Issue #7**: Ready for development - Create 18 CMDS labels with proper colors/descriptions
- **Issues #8-10**: Sequenced in Next backlog dependent on label creation
- **NEXT_TASKS.md**: Updated with clear priority queue and task descriptions
- **Planning Complete**: All checklist items completed, ready for mode transition

## Ready for Mode Switch

### Next Session Should Start With
1. `/clear` to clear context and prepare for mode transition
2. `/dev` mode to implement Issue #7 - Create and configure CMDS GitHub label system
3. Follow TDD approach for GitHub label creation and validation
4. Create feature branch for CRD #6 work according to git workflow rules
5. Implement all 18 CMDS labels with proper colors and descriptions

## Selected Task for Development
**Issue #7: Create and configure CMDS GitHub label system**

- **Approach**: Use GitHub CLI to create labels according to task-management.md specifications
- **Tests**: Verify all labels exist with correct colors and descriptions
- **Estimated time**: 1 hour
- **Branch**: feature/crd-6-github-labels (to be created in /dev mode)

## Session Context Summary
Planning mode successfully executed complete task breakdown for CRD #6 (GitHub labels). Created systematic approach with four focused tasks that address label creation, application, kick mode integration, and documentation. Issue #7 selected as foundational work that enables all other CMDS issue tracking capabilities.

**PLANNING COMPLETE**: Ready for /dev mode to implement GitHub label system following CMDS TDD methodology.
