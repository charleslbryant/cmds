## Session Information
- **Started**: 2025-07-15
- **Focus**: Dev mode execution for Issue #7 - GitHub labels creation
- **Task**: Implement CMDS GitHub label system with 18 labels
- **Current Status**: Implementation complete, ready for /deliver mode

## Session Progress

### âœ… Completed This Session (Dev Mode Execution)
1. **Mode Context Loading** - Read all rule files and session context files
2. **TDD Implementation** - Created test script and followed red-green-refactor cycle
3. **Test Creation** - Built comprehensive test in tests/test-github-labels.sh
4. **Label Creation** - Implemented script to create all 18 CMDS labels with proper colors
5. **Test Verification** - Confirmed all 18 labels exist and test passes
6. **Refactoring** - Organized scripts and tests in proper directory structure
7. **Git Workflow** - Created feature branch, committed with proper format
8. **Session Context Updates** - Updated CURRENT_STATE.md and NEXT_TASKS.md with completion

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made
- `scripts/create-github-labels.sh` - GitHub CLI script to create all 18 CMDS labels
- `tests/test-github-labels.sh` - Comprehensive test suite for label verification
- **GitHub Repository** - Created all 18 CMDS labels with proper colors and descriptions
- `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Updated with Issue #7 completion
- `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md` - Marked Issue #7 as completed
- `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md` - Updated session progress documentation

### ðŸ“‹ Key Implementation Decisions
1. **TDD Approach**: Used test-first development with shell script tests
2. **Directory Structure**: Organized scripts in scripts/ and tests in tests/
3. **Label Creation**: All 18 labels created with exact specifications from design document
4. **Verification**: Comprehensive test ensures all labels exist with correct properties

### ðŸš€ Development Deliverables
- **18 GitHub Labels**: Complete CMDS label system created and verified
- **Creation Script**: Reusable script for label creation (scripts/create-github-labels.sh)
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive verification test (tests/test-github-labels.sh)
- **Issue #7 Complete**: All acceptance criteria met and verified

## Ready for Mode Switch

### âœ… Dev Mode Checklist Complete
- [x] Read Mode Context Files
- [x] Write Failing Test (Created comprehensive label verification test)
- [x] Run Test (Verified test fails - red phase)
- [x] Implement Minimum (Created all 18 GitHub labels)
- [x] Run Test (Verified test passes - green phase)
- [x] Refactor (Organized scripts and tests properly)
- [x] Commit (Committed with proper message format)
- [x] Verify Git Context (Created feature branch, pulled main)
- [x] Check Documentation Impact (Minimal impact - infrastructure feature)
- [x] Update Session Context Files (Updated all session context files)
- [x] Ready for Mode Switch (All checklist items complete)

### Next Session Should Start With
1. `/clear` to clear context and prepare for mode transition
2. `/deliver` mode to push feature branch and create PR for Issue #7
3. Follow git workflow rules for pushing and PR creation
4. Consider selecting next task from Now priority queue (Issue #4 or #5)
5. Continue with remaining CRD #6 tasks (Issues #8-10) as needed

## Completed Task
**Issue #7: Create and configure CMDS GitHub label system** âœ…
- **Goal**: Create all 18 CMDS labels (Priority, Status, Scope, Type) with proper colors âœ…
- **Approach**: Used GitHub CLI with TDD approach and shell script tests âœ…
- **Tests**: All labels verified to exist with correct colors and descriptions âœ…
- **Actual time**: 1 hour (as estimated)
- **Branch**: feature/crd-6-github-labels (created and committed)

## Session Context Summary
Dev mode successfully implemented complete CMDS GitHub label system for Issue #7. Used TDD approach with shell script testing, created all 18 required labels with proper colors and descriptions, and organized code in proper directory structure. Issue #7 now complete and ready for delivery.

**PARTIAL DEVELOPMENT COMPLETE**: Issue #7 implementation complete, but CRD #6 requires additional integration tasks (Issues #11-13) before full completion.
