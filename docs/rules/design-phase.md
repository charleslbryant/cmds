# Design Phase Documentation

## Overview
The design phase bridges the gap between product requirements and implementation, ensuring thoughtful architecture and user experience decisions before development begins.

## Design Phase Workflow

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Review product requirements and user stories
- Identify technical constraints and dependencies
- Define success criteria and acceptance tests

### 2. Architecture Design
- Document high-level system architecture
- Identify components and their interactions
- Define data models and API contracts
- Consider scalability and performance requirements

### 3. User Experience Design
- Create user flow diagrams
- Design interface mockups (if applicable)
- Define interaction patterns
- Document accessibility requirements

### 4. Technical Design Document (TDD)
For each feature, create a technical design document including:
- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Architecture decisions
- Implementation approach
- Testing strategy
- Risk assessment
- Timeline estimates

### 5. Design Review
- Present design to stakeholders
- Gather feedback and iterate
- Document decisions and rationale
- Obtain approval before proceeding to development

## Design Artifacts

### Required Documents
1. **Feature Design Doc** - Technical approach and architecture
2. **API Design** - Endpoints, request/response formats
3. **Data Model** - Schema definitions and relationships
4. **Test Plan** - Testing approach and scenarios

### Optional Documents
- UI/UX mockups
- Sequence diagrams
- Performance benchmarks
- Security threat model

## Integration with Development Cycle

### Updated Development Cycle
1. **Plan** - Define requirements and objectives
2. **Design** - Architecture and technical approach (NEW)
3. **Develop** - Implementation following design
4. **QA** - Testing and quality assurance
5. **Evaluate** - Review against requirements

### Design Phase Gates
Before moving to development:
- [ ] Design document reviewed and approved
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Test scenarios defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Risk mitigation planned

## Design Templates
See `/docs/templates/design/` for:
- Feature design template
- API design template
- Architecture decision record (ADR) template

## Best Practices

### DO
- Start with the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Consider future extensibility without over-engineering
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Include error handling and edge cases
- Define clear interfaces between components

### DON'T
- Skip design for "simple" features
- Design in isolation without stakeholder input
- Ignore non-functional requirements
- Forget about maintenance and operations
- Over-architect for hypothetical future needs
