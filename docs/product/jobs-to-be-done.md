## Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) for CMDS

The Context-Managed Development System (CMDS) addresses the needs of developers and teams working in AI-assisted and agentic software development environments. It offers structured workflows, command-based rituals, and persistent context to ensure consistency, quality, and collaboration across human and AI contributors.

### JTBD 1: Structured Project Kickoff

**When I’m starting a new AI-assisted project, I want a structured and repeatable kickoff so I don’t waste time setting up conventions or templates.**

### JTBD 2: Persistent Context Between Sessions

**When I resume a development session with an AI assistant, I want to pick up where I left off without repeating context, so I can maintain flow and continuity.**

### JTBD 3: Workflow Consistency Across Teams and Agents

**When multiple developers and AI agents are contributing, I want everyone to follow the same workflows so we reduce friction, bugs, and misalignment.**

### JTBD 4: Clear Task Handoffs

**When handing off a task to another person or agent, I want them to understand what’s been done, what’s next, and how to proceed so they don’t have to start from scratch.**

### JTBD 5: Quality Assurance and TDD Integration

**When shipping code, I want to ensure it aligns with our design, includes tests, and maintains quality standards so we can avoid regressions and technical debt.**

### JTBD 6: Documentation Alignment

**When documentation gets out of sync with code, I want to be warned and offered tools to fix it so our documentation remains reliable and useful.**

### JTBD 7: Unified Workflow for Humans and AI Agents

**When AI agents assist me, I want them to follow the same process and rules as human developers so we can collaborate effectively and predictably.**
